## Cost Analysis in Implementing Security Objectives within SSDLC
Integrating security objectives into each phase of the SDLC incurs various costs, including time, resources, business impact, and financial burden. Here's an indepth look at these considerations and effective approaches to balancing costs in each SDLC phase:


### 1.	Requirements Gathering
**•	Time:** Adding security requirements from the beginning extends planning, as stakeholders need time to analyze threats and define security needs.

**•	Resources: **Requires team members with knowledge in security analysis, potentially increasing staff hours.

•	Business Logic Impact: Modifying business logic to include security requirements may impact original project scope and require adjustments.

•	Financial Burden: Upfront costs for additional security expertise, but this investment reduces downstream costs for fixing security issues.
  
   **Cost-effective Approach: **

•	Leverage security templates for requirement gathering (e.g., OWASP ASVS) to streamline the process.

•	Use collaborative threat modeling sessions involving both security experts and developers, reducing time and aligning security with business goals early on.


###  2. Design Phase

•	Time: Secure design practices add time for architecture adjustments and threat modeling iterations, especially when complex security requirements need precise implementation.

•	Resources: Demands specialized knowledge to design secure data flows and enforce access control measures.

•	Business Logic Impact: Security considerations may impact usability and functionality, requiring compromises or alternatives to initial designs.

•	Financial Burden: Investing in security-oriented design tools and consultants can raise costs, but mitigates future risks and reduces long-term expenses.
   
   **Cost-effective Approach: **
•	Use automated threat modeling tools that integrate into design software, reducing the need for extensive manual reviews.

•	Crosstrain team members in secure design to avoid hiring additional resources, lowering costs by building internal expertise over time.

 ## 3. Implementation Phase
•	Time: Implementing secure coding practices can increase development time due to additional coding, code reviews, and tool integration.

•	Resources: Requires security-aware developers and potentially secure coding tool licenses for SAST.

•	Business Logic Impact: May slightly reduce development speed, as developers need to balance security with functionality and performance.

•	Financial Burden: Investing in secure development tools and training can be costly, but it reduces the chance of severe vulnerabilities, saving money on post-deployment fixes.
   
   **Cost-effective Approach:**
•	Utilize free or opensource SAST tools like SonarQube or OWASP Dependency-Check where possible to reduce licensing costs.
•	Automate code reviews and standardize secure coding practices across the team, reducing developer training time and enforcing consistency.

 ### 4. Testing Phase
•	Time: Penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and manual code reviews add time, especially when performed thoroughly.

•	Resources: Requires skilled security testers and tools like DAST or SAST software, which may require specialized training.

•	Business Logic Impact: Testing may reveal issues in business logic that require design modifications, potentially delaying release schedules.

•	Financial Burden: Security testing tools and third-party services for penetration testing can be expensive.

  ** Cost-effective Approach:**
•	Automate vulnerability scanning where possible, reserving manual penetration testing for critical components.

•	Benchmark security standards (e.g., OWASP ASVS, WSTG, OSAF-Model) as checklists, guiding the team to focus on the most impactful vulnerabilities, thereby minimizing test cycles and cost.
 
 ### 5. Deployment and Maintenance Phase
•	Time: Routine maintenance, patch management, and monitoring demand continuous attention, especially as new threats emerge.

•	Resources: Requires ongoing access to security tools and skilled personnel to manage and respond to threats.

•	Business Logic Impact: Post-deployment security fixes might require business logic modifications, potentially disrupting user experience.

•	Financial Burden: Costs include maintaining security licenses, running routine audits, and patching/updating software.
   **Cost-effective Approach:**
•	Implement automated patch management systems and monitor for new vulnerabilities in real-time, reducing response time and manual labor.

•	Use cloud-based security monitoring and outsourced security services (e.g., MSSPs) where inhouse resources are limited, optimizing security without significantly increasing fixed costs.
