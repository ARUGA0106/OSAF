# Phase 5: Testing â€“ Security Enhanced SDLC (SSDLC)

The Testing Phase is a pivotal point for identifying and remediating vulnerabilities before the application is deployed. This phase incorporates Application Under Test (AUT) procedures, as well as specialized security testing methods like business logic error testing, penetration testing, and automated scanning. Integrating OWASP, SANS, and WSTG guidance helps ensure that each aspect of the application is tested for security, especially focusing on areas that are often exploited, such as logic flaws in business workflows.

## Key Security Objectives

1. **Automated and Manual Security Testing**: Utilize automated testing for routine checks and manual testing for identifying complex vulnerabilities.
2. **Business Logic Error Testing**: Detect errors in business logic that automated tools might miss, as these can lead to unauthorized actions within the application.
3. **Penetration Testing**: Simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities and assess their potential impact.
4. **Benchmarking and Checklist Validation**: Use benchmarks and checklists from frameworks like WSTG, OWASP, and SANS to validate test coverage.
5. **Application Security Validation (AUT)**: Conduct detailed AUT to verify that the application meets security requirements across all functions.

|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Automated Security Testing**       | - [OWASP Top 10]: Automate security scans to detect known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.<br>- [WSTG]: Integrate continuous security scanning for regular detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities.<br>- [SANS 25]: Automate checks for common weaknesses such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and sensitive data exposure. | - Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Use tools like SonarQube or Veracode to perform static code analysis.<br>- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Employ tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to scan the running application for vulnerabilities.<br>- Dependency Scanners: Use tools like Snyk or Dependabot to find vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. |
| **2. Business Logic Error Testing**     | - [OWASP Top 10]: Validate that business logic aligns with security requirements to prevent unintended consequences, such as bypassing workflows or unauthorized actions.<br>- [WSTG]: Conduct detailed testing to detect logic flaws that could compromise security.<br>- [SANS 25]: Identify and address logic flaws that could lead to unauthorized data access or alteration. | - Manual Business Logic Testing: Execute tests manually to simulate edge cases and workflows, particularly where logic flaws could enable privilege escalation or bypass checks.<br>- Test Case Mapping to Business Requirements: Cross-reference business requirements with test cases to ensure logic validation.<br>- Threat Modeling Validation: Reassess threat models to ensure that all potential business logic vulnerabilities are accounted for in test cases. |
| **3. Penetration Testing**              | - [WSTG]: Perform controlled penetration testing to emulate external and internal attacks on the application.<br>- [OWASP Top 10]: Test for a broad range of vulnerabilities, including authentication flaws and access control weaknesses.<br>- [SANS 25]: Identify weaknesses in the application that could lead to unauthorized access or data manipulation. | - Penetration Testing Frameworks: Use frameworks like Metasploit and Kali Linux tools for structured penetration testing.<br>- Network and Application Layer Pen Testing: Assess both network and application vulnerabilities, targeting common issues such as open ports and injection flaws.<br>- Manual Exploitation: Conduct manual testing to validate the severity and exploitability of findings from automated tools. |
| **4. Checklist and Benchmark Validation** | - [WSTG]: Use security benchmarks and checklists to verify comprehensive test coverage across all identified security areas.<br>- [OWASP Top 10]: Ensure all known OWASP vulnerabilities are tested for in the application.<br>- [SANS 25]: Verify that all SANS/CWE Top 25 weaknesses are addressed within the test cases. | - Security Checklists: Use OWASP ASVS, SANS Top 25, and WSTG checklists to guide testing efforts and confirm all critical areas are covered.<br>- OWASP DependencyCheck: Run OWASP DependencyCheck to validate third-party dependencies against known security vulnerabilities.<br>- Regular Review of Testing Artifacts: Maintain and review testing artifacts, including checklists, to ensure up-to-date coverage of the latest vulnerabilities. |
| **5. Application Security Validation (AUT)** | - [OWASP Top 10]: Validate that all application functions are secure, ensuring vulnerabilities like broken authentication and security misconfigurations are remediated.<br>- [WSTG]: Conduct end-to-end testing to confirm that application security requirements are fulfilled. | - Comprehensive AUT: Conduct automated and manual testing across all application features to ensure security controls work as expected.<br>- Fuzz Testing: Use fuzz testing tools (e.g., Peach Fuzzer) to test inputs and identify unexpected behavior or application crashes.<br>- Security Regression Testing: Execute regression tests to verify that recent changes have not reintroduced vulnerabilities. |
