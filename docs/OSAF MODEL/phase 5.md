# Phase 5: Testing – Security Enhanced SDLC (SSDLC)

The Testing Phase is a pivotal point for identifying and remediating vulnerabilities before the application is deployed. This phase incorporates Application Under Test (AUT) procedures, as well as specialized security testing methods like business logic error testing, penetration testing, and automated scanning. Integrating OWASP, SANS, and WSTG guidance helps ensure that each aspect of the application is tested for security, especially focusing on areas that are often exploited, such as logic flaws in business workflows.

## Key Security Objectives

1. **Automated and Manual Security Testing**: Utilize automated testing for routine checks and manual testing for identifying complex vulnerabilities.
2. **Business Logic Error Testing**: Detect errors in business logic that automated tools might miss, as these can lead to unauthorized actions within the application.
3. **Penetration Testing**: Simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities and assess their potential impact.
4. **Benchmarking and Checklist Validation**: Use benchmarks and checklists from frameworks like WSTG, OWASP, and SANS to validate test coverage.
5. **Application Security Validation (AUT)**: Conduct detailed AUT to verify that the application meets security requirements across all functions.
