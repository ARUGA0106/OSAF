# Phase 6: Continuous Maintenance â€“ Security Enhanced SDLC (SSDLC)

The Continuous Maintenance Phase ensures that security remains a top priority throughout the application's lifecycle, with SecOps practices ingrained into the maintenance routine. This phase focuses on managing documentation, threat classification, scheduled maintenance, and vulnerability response, all within an evolving security landscape. Here, adjustments to scope due to new requirements or discovered threats are handled with a proactive approach, integrating frameworks like OWASP, SANS, and WSTG for sustained security performance.

## Key Security Objectives

1. **Comprehensive Security Documentation**: Maintain updated documentation of all security configurations, policies, procedures, and test results.
2. **Threat Classification and Vulnerability Management**: Prioritize and categorize threats based on risk and impact, using standards to consistently classify and respond to vulnerabilities.
3. **Scheduled Maintenance and Security Audits**: Set up a regular schedule for updating software, testing security controls, and auditing security policies.
4. **Robust Incident Response**: Develop a proactive plan for vulnerability detection and response, integrating SecOps for continuous monitoring and rapid response.
5. **Scope Adjustment for Security**: Prepare for security impact when adjusting the application's scope, ensuring all security controls remain aligned with updated functionalities and requirements.

| **1. Comprehensive Security Documentation** | - [OWASP Top 10]: Document all vulnerabilities, mitigations, and security controls for future reference.<br>- [WSTG]: Maintain a record of all security tests, including version history for transparency in audits.<br>- [SANS 25]: Record all critical weaknesses identified and actions taken, enabling traceability and adherence to standards. | - Security Knowledge Base: Use a secure documentation tool, such as Confluence or Notion, to record all security findings and updates.<br>- Configuration Management: Maintain configuration files under version control (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket) to track changes and document impact assessments.<br>- Policy and Compliance Tracking: Record policy compliance and any deviations, mapping them against standards like NIST and GDPR. |
| **2. Threat Classification and Vulnerability Management** | - [OWASP Top 10]: Categorize vulnerabilities by risk (e.g., high, medium, low) and prioritize based on severity and exposure.<br>- [WSTG]: Use a structured threat model to assess each vulnerability in relation to business impact.<br>- [SANS 25]: Assign threat classifications to prioritize based on CWE category and potential exploitability. | - Threat Intelligence Platforms: Use platforms like MISP or ThreatConnect for monitoring and classifying new threats.<br>- Risk Scoring Tools: Implement risk scoring tools, such as CVSS calculators, to assign risk levels to identified vulnerabilities.<br>- Threat Classification Frameworks: Utilize OWASP Risk Rating Methodology or the MITRE ATT&CK framework to prioritize and respond to threats effectively. |
| **3. Scheduled Maintenance and Security Audits** | - [WSTG]: Conduct periodic security audits to verify that all security controls remain effective.<br>- [OWASP Top 10]: Regularly patch known vulnerabilities to prevent security drift.<br>- [SANS 25]: Schedule recurring scans to detect new or reintroduced vulnerabilities. | - Vulnerability Scanning Tools: Run scheduled scans with tools like Nessus or Qualys to detect any unpatched or newly emerging vulnerabilities.<br>- Security Control Audits: Conduct audits of implemented security controls to ensure they meet operational standards.<br>- Automated Updates and Patch Management: Schedule updates for software and dependencies, using tools like WSUS or Chef for automated patching. |
| **4. Robust Incident Response (SecOps Integration)** | - [OWASP Top 10]: Implement response protocols for potential security incidents.<br>- [WSTG]: Adopt a SecOps strategy for real-time monitoring and immediate remediation.<br>- [SANS 25]: Define incident response plans for common threats and conduct regular drills. | - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Use SIEM platforms, such as Splunk or Sentinel, for continuous monitoring, alerting, and incident response.<br>- Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): Deploy IDPS tools like Snort or Suricata to detect and mitigate intrusions as they happen.<br>- Automated Incident Response: Implement incident response automation (e.g., using SOAR solutions) to streamline response efforts. |
| **5. Scope Adjustment for Security**    | - [WSTG]: Assess and mitigate any security implications arising from changes in application scope.<br>- [OWASP Top 10]: Ensure security requirements are updated with new features or changes.<br>- [SANS 25]: Review security implications for third-party integrations or changes in architecture. | - Change Management Protocols: Employ change management tools (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira) to track modifications and their security impact.<br>- Security Review Meetings: Hold regular security review meetings to discuss and assess new features, ensuring that security is a consideration in every change.<br>- Agile Security Integration: Integrate security reviews into agile sprint planning to ensure ongoing alignment with security objectives. |

# Conclusion

In summary, the Security Enhanced SDLC (SSDLC) integrates security practices into every phase of the software development lifecycle, ensuring that security is not an afterthought but an integral component of the process. By leveraging the guidance of OWASP, SANS, and WSTG, teams can proactively identify and mitigate security risks while also fostering a culture of security awareness and responsibility among all stakeholders. The implementation of this framework will help organizations develop resilient software applications that are secure, compliant, and prepared for the evolving threat landscape.
