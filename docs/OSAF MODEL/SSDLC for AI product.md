## SSDLC for AI Products

In developing secure AI products, the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) integrates specialized measures to protect AI systems at every stage. This includes security protocols for data privacy, model integrity, and regulatory compliance. By using well-known security models, such as Microsoft's STRIDE and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, we outline key objectives and strategies specific to AI applications like virtual assistants, chatbots, and predictive models.

|-----|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1   | **Requirements Gathering**   | Identify and outline security requirements for AI products.       | **Data Privacy and Compliance**: Define requirements to secure sensitive user data, ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA. **Model Security**: Set protections against data poisoning and model inversion attacks to prevent malicious input alterations or data extraction. **User Interaction and Trust**: Outline safeguards to avoid misuse, such as data injection attacks on chatbots or influencing predictive models with adversarial inputs. | NIST AI RMF             |
| 2   | **Design**                  | Integrate security measures in both AI model and architecture.   | **Authentication and Access Control**: Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive components. **Encryption and Secure Data Storage**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit, especially data for training or AI-generated. **Explainability and Transparency**: Add logging and explanation mechanisms to clarify AI decisions, enhancing trust in high-stakes predictive environments. | STRIDE, NIST AI RMF     |
| 3   | **Implementation**          | Develop secure AI code with protection against reverse engineering.   | **Secure Coding Practices**: Apply secure coding standards to validate input data and avoid injection attacks. **Model Protection**: Use obfuscation techniques or differential privacy to protect models from reverse-engineering. **Data Sanitization**: Filter and preprocess data inputs, preventing injection attacks on chatbots or virtual assistants. | STRIDE, OWASP AI Security |
| 4   | **Testing**                 | Conduct adversarial and vulnerability testing to ensure AI security.    | **Adversarial Testing**: Use penetration tests to see how the AI responds to malicious inputs. **Bias and Fairness Testing**: Ensure models are free from harmful biases to prevent unpredictable behaviors. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly scan AI APIs and model-serving platforms, especially in cloud environments. | STRIDE, OWASP AI Security |
| 5   | **Deployment**              | Enable continuous monitoring and secure access management post-deployment. | **Model Monitoring and Threat Detection**: Monitor models for signs of adversarial attacks, performance degradation, and unusual inputs. **Automated Updates and Patch Management**: Establish secure systems for automatic patches and updates. **Access Audits**: Log and review access, tracking changes to models or environments for compliance and breach detection. | STRIDE                   |
| 6   | **Maintenance and Monitoring** | Perform ongoing monitoring, retraining, and security audits.             | **Model Drift Detection**: Regularly check and retrain models to adjust to evolving data patterns. **Security Audits and Compliance Checks**: Ensure AI models and applications adhere to security standards and regulatory requirements. **Incident Response Plans for AI**: Develop protocols specific to AI-related security breaches, including responses to data poisoning attacks or adversarial model exploitation. | NIST AI RMF             |
