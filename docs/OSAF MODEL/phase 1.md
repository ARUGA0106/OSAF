# Security Enhanced SDLC (SSDLC) Methodology: OSAF-Model-
## requirement gathering phase

In building a secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC), incorporating established security frameworks and standards is essential. This methodology examines each SDLC phase from a security implementation perspective, leveraging the strengths of the WSTG (Web Security Testing Guide), OWASP Top 10, and SANS/CWE Top 25 to form a comprehensive approach. This fusion allows for a robust checklist and practical guidance to systematically address security risks.

| S/No | SSDLC Phase                | Key Security Objectives                                                                                         | Implementation Item                                           | Code             | Tools & Techniques                               |
|------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Requirements Gathering / Business Analysis | Define and document security goals and standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA compliance); identify confidentiality, integrity, and availability needs. | Document security goals, align with regulatory standards. | [WSTG] | Documentation tools, Compliance checklists    |
| 2    | Requirements Gathering / Business Analysis | Align business logic with security goals; assess business functions for inherent security risks.                | Map security goals to core business processes.                | [OWASP Top 10] | Business logic review tools                     |
| 3    | Requirements Gathering / Business Analysis | Threat Identification; assess potential threats by mapping out initial security requirements.                   | Perform high-level threat modeling                           | [SANS 25] | Threat modeling tools, Risk assessment templates |
| 4    | Requirements Gathering / Business Analysis | Define and document access and authorization protocols; identify roles and privileges.                          | Define role-based access and privilege control.               | [WSTG] [OWASP] | Role-based access control (RBAC) tools          |
| 5    | Requirements Gathering / Business Analysis | Identify and secure data privacy needs; ensure encryption and secure transmission protocols are in place.       | Document encryption requirements and protocols.               | [SANS 25] | Encryption tools, Data masking                  |
| 6    | Requirements Gathering / Business Analysis | Plan for secure configuration management; set guidelines for environment security.                             | Define secure setup for production and staging environments.  | [WSTG] [OWASP] | Configuration management tools                  |
| 7    | Requirements Gathering / Business Analysis | Evaluate logging and monitoring needs; establish logging practices to detect threats.                           | Plan for robust logging and monitoring mechanisms.            | [OWASP] [SANS] | Logging tools, Monitoring solutions             |

SANS 25: CWE Top 25



The **OSAF-Model: Security Enhanced SDLC** is an adaptable methodology that integrates industry-recognized security standards (WSTG, OWASP Top 10, SANS/CWE Top 25) into each phase of the software development lifecycle. Designed to promote a secure-by-design approach, this framework enables developers and architects to systematically identify, prioritize, and address security risks, with clear objectives and practical tools & techniques. This model serves as a core component of Cybershield's Open Software Alliance Foundation (OSAF) project.
