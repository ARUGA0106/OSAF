### Phase 4: Deployment â€“ Security Enhanced SDLC (SSDLC)

The Deployment Phase is critical for ensuring that the application is securely configured and ready for production. It involves establishing a secure infrastructure, managing environment variables and sensitive data, enforcing access controls, and deploying monitoring systems. By combining elements of OWASP Top 10, SANS/CWE Top 25, and WSTG into a security-focused deployment methodology, this phase ensures that the application remains protected against exploitation once it goes live.

#### Key Security Objectives

| Objective                                           | Description                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Establish Secure Infrastructure                      | Ensure the server environment and deployment configuration are fortified to minimize exposure to potential attacks. |
| Configuration Management                            | Enforce proper configuration management and prevent misconfigurations, a common source of vulnerabilities. |
| Access Control and Least Privilege                  | Implement robust access control policies, ensuring users and systems operate with the minimum permissions needed. |
| Continuous Monitoring and Incident Detection         | Set up monitoring to detect security events in real time, providing visibility into potential threats.   |
