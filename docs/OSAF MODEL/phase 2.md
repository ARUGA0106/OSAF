# Phase 2: Design â€“ Security Enhanced SDLC (SSDLC)

In the Design Phase, security controls are architected based on requirements from the previous phase. This phase incorporates frameworks like OWASP Top 10, SANS/CWE Top 25, and WSTG to build a secure application architecture that mitigates known vulnerabilities, reduces attack surfaces, and enforces secure design principles. Developers and architects must follow security guidelines, employ security-focused tools, and use techniques to create a robust foundation.
