## Overview of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Security Approaches
The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) provides a structured framework for planning, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software. Typically, SDLC is divided into five key phases, each addressing specific aspects of software creation. By embedding security practices into each of these phases, we transform SDLC into a Secure SDLC (SSDLC), which proactively mitigates vulnerabilities and strengthens the overall security of applications.
 
 ### 1.	Requirements Gathering
The initial phase focuses on gathering business, technical, and functional requirements for the software. Security requirements, often overlooked, should also be defined here to set a foundation for secure design and implementation.

**Security Approach:**

•	Security Requirement Analysis: Identify security needs such as data confidentiality, user authentication, access control, and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

•	Threat Modeling: Conduct threat modeling to understand potential attack vectors and define mitigations early on. Tools like Microsoft Threat Modeling can help visualize and document security risks associated with different features.

•	Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation of both functional and security requirements, ensuring that developers and stakeholders understand security priorities from the start.

### 2.	Design
During the design phase, the architecture and detailed design for the software are developed. Decisions on software structure, components, and interfaces are made here.

**Security Approach:**
•	Secure Architecture Design: Ensure that the architecture is resilient to known threats. This includes setting up boundaries between components, minimizing trust zones, and planning for data encryption, network isolation, and API security.

•	Threat Modeling (Revisited): Refine threat models based on the detailed design, highlighting critical areas that require security controls.

•	Security Design Documentation: Document security considerations within the design, such as encryption standards, access controls, and secure interaction protocols, for easy reference throughout development and testing.

 ### 3. Implementation
The actual code for the software is written during this phase. The focus here is on following design specifications to build the application’s core functionality.

**Security Approach:**

•	Source Code Review: Conduct regular code reviews focused on identifying security flaws, using static application security testing (SAST) tools like SonarQube or Check-marx to catch common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, crosssite scripting).

•	Secure Coding Practices: Train developers on secure coding standards and use language-specific guidelines (e.g., OWASP Secure Coding Practices). Emphasize validation and sanitization of input to avoid injection attacks.

•	Documentation of Security Checks: Maintain documentation for security checks and coding standards used to ensure code security, facilitating better handoffs and accountability across teams.
 
 ### 4. Testing
The testing phase verifies that the software meets the defined requirements and functions correctly. Security testing is crucial here to identify potential weaknesses before deployment.

**Security Approach:**
•	Penetration Testing: Perform penetration tests (using frameworks like PTES) to evaluate the application’s defenses against real-world attacks. Include tests for authentication, data protection, and access control.

•	Benchmark & Checklist-Based Testing: Use benchmarks like the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) and checklists (e.g., Web Security Testing Guide  WSTG) to systematically test for vulnerabilities.

•	Automated Vulnerability Scanning: Integrate tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite for dynamic application security testing (DAST) to detect runtime issues, misconfigurations, and insecure components.

•	Documentation and Validation: Document all identified issues and resolutions, validating that all security requirements have been met prior to release.

### 5.	Deployment and Maintenance
In this final phase, the application is deployed to a production environment and regularly maintained to ensure stability and security over time.

**Security Approach:**
•	Secure Deployment: Ensure secure configurations during deployment (e.g., disabling unnecessary services, securing databases, using HTTPS). Automated deployment scripts with secure settings should be used to prevent human error.

•	Ongoing Monitoring and Testing: Continuously monitor the application for new threats and vulnerabilities. Tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems can alert to suspicious activities.

•	Patch Management: Establish a patch management process to update components and libraries regularly, addressing vulnerabilities as they are discovered.

•	Regular Security Audits: Conduct routine security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate potential threats.

•	Documentation for Incident Response: Maintain updated documentation for incident response, including logs of patch updates, configuration changes, and security testing.
