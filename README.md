# OSAF-Model: Open Software Alliance Foundation - Software Security Framework

The **OSAF-Model** is a Knowladge-based security-focused software development framework founded by Godwin S. Aruga, a DevSecOps Engineer, Cybersecurity Analyst, and Solution Architect, under the Cybershield OSAF Project. This model is designed to enhance software security across the SDLC by integrating security objectives, industry standards, and best practices from OWASP, SANS, and WSTG.

## Getting Started
Learn how to integrate the OSAF-Model in your projects [here](docs/Introduction.md).

## Core Components
The OSAF-Model includes:
- Security requirements for each SDLC phase
- Integration of industry standards (OWASP Top 10, SANS 25, WSTG)
- Tool and technique recommendations per phase
- Guidelines for ongoing maintenance

### Open Software Alliance Foundation (OSAF) - Software Security Framework Development Model (OSAF-Model)

Welcome to the **OSAF-Model repository**, part of Cybershield’s OSAF Project. Founded by **Godwin S. Aruga** (DevSecOps Engineer, Cybersecurity Analyst, and Solution Architect), the OSAF-Model represents a cutting-edge approach to secure software development. The framework is designed to provide a comprehensive, adaptable process that enables security integration throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC), enhancing the resilience and security of web applications and software products.

#### About OSAF-Model

The OSAF-Model offers an open, collaborative, and robust methodology for organizations and developers focused on building secure software. By leveraging industry-recognized standards and frameworks—such as OWASP Top 10, SANS Top 25, and WSTG—the model emphasizes security at each SDLC phase, from requirements gathering to ongoing maintenance. This proactive security approach ensures that vulnerabilities are mitigated early and systematically.

#### Key Components

- **Secure SDLC Phases**: Structured guidance and best practices across each SDLC phase—requirements, design, implementation, deployment, testing, and maintenance—with security objectives, recommended methods, and checklists.
- **Framework Integration**: Practical checklists and control objectives derived from leading security frameworks, including OWASP, SANS, and WSTG, to ensure alignment with industry standards.
- **Tools and Techniques**: Recommendations on tools, testing approaches, and techniques such as threat modeling, source code review, and penetration testing to ensure robust validation at each phase.
- **Continuous Maintenance and Response**: Strategies for ongoing monitoring, threat classification, scheduled maintenance, and vulnerability management, ensuring that applications remain secure over time.

#### Getting Started

Explore our documentation to learn how to integrate the OSAF-Model into your development processes. Whether you’re a developer, architect, or security professional, the OSAF-Model equips you with the tools and structure needed to build secure applications from the ground up.

#### Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to advance the OSAF-Model. If you have insights, tool recommendations, or updates to existing practices, your expertise is invaluable in strengthening this unified approach to secure software development.
